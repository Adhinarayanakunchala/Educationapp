                <h1>IELTS COACHING</h1><br/>
                <p>IELTS stands for International English Language Testing Systems. This is a strict test designed to assess the
                    aptitude of a candidate in the English language. IELTS checks the abilities of a student in the areas of reading,
                    writing, listening and speaking. The British Council IDP Australia and the University of Cambridge own this test jointly.
                    It is a widely acclaimed test, accepted as a proof in a majority of the countries. Students who wish to pursue a course abroad need
                    to attempt the “Academic Module”. The general public that wants to immigrate or attend vocational programs can take the “General Training”.

                <h1>TOEFL COACHING</h1><br />
                <p>Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL) is a standardized test used to measure the candidate’s proficiency in the English language. It examines the student’s
                    ability in the sectors of writing, reading, speaking and listening. This is crucial for those who want to pursue studies in a foreign land on undergraduate or graduate level.
                    It is important because some countries do not accept the results of IELTS. There, TOEFL is the proof of English proficiency. Unlike IELTS, TOEFL results are measured in scores and not bands.
